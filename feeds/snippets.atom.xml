&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting&lt;/strong&gt;: Two random members of the Tsuruya-tachi, let's call them A(kito) and B(unkichi) for convenience's sake, are sitting at the bar and having a drink in a place all but owned by the organization they belong to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip;speaking of Kyon-dono, what do you think of the new girl he brought in?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The new girl? Ah, do you mean Asakura-san?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I don't know her name. Is she the one with the long blue hair and&amp;ndash;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes, that's her.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I noticed she was wearing a pin. What does she do?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises a eyebrow*&lt;/em&gt; You don't know?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, she was wearing one of the suits and she doesn't seem the type for labour. Management?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You really&amp;hellip;? Oh! That's right. They sent you out of town last week. Wanna guess again?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not in the mood for your games. Just tell me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yojimbo.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bodyguard? Really? Assigned to whom?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*smirks*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You little&amp;ndash; Alright, I'll play, but you're paying for my drinks if I got it right. Deal?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deal. You got three guesses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;She's guarding Tsuruya-hime. Being both of them girls around the same age, it's easier for her to remain close.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Good guess, but that's not it. Two left.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Really? Let me see&amp;hellip; How about this: Asakura is guarding that girl we got out of the hands of those Sumiyoshi-rengo. What was her name again?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sasaki-chan&amp;hellip; but wrong again. Last try.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*thinks to himself for a while, plays with his glass of whisky*&lt;/em&gt; I got it. It was a tricky question. Asakura was assigned as a "plant" to Tsuruya-hime and Kyon-dono's school. She's supposed to remain as a "sleeping" back-up unless something comes up.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Three strikes and out!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*rolls eyes*&lt;/em&gt; Alright, you got me. Just spill it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kyon-dono.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;......what? That can't be right. Why would &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; need a bodyguard? You sure she's not his personal assistant or something?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think she does a little of that too, but I heard she's getting "danger pay" and everything.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That doesn't make any sense. I don't think a girl looking like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be any good in a fight&amp;ndash;&amp;hellip; wait. Don't you think she could be....?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Be what?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You know, his&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;*ambiguous gesture*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*looks around, whispers*&lt;/em&gt; Watch your mouth, you fool. &lt;em&gt;*normal voice*&lt;/em&gt; Nope, she's the real deal. From the moment you didn't know who she was, I knew you missed the news about the show. That was something else.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The show?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yep. Kyon-dono seemed to know that it would be difficult to believe that he of all people would put someone like her watching his back. So, the first time he brought her along to the Towers, he presented her to guys. Nothing big, just a quick introduction to whoever happened to be in the lounge at the time, like me.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What happened?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At first, nothing. Even though everybody thought about it, no one wanted to be the first to question the Kowa-Keigo to his face. So, he told us how the two of them were taught to fight by the same person. Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; got everybody curious.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I can see why. The past of our boy is kind of a riddle for the ages. All clean and boring on the surface, but nobody like that should know how to do what he does. The most people got was that he has an uncle working for the Sonozaki-gumi in the North.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, his next words were even better, and I quote, "unlike me though, she's the talented one."&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;......&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Precisely. Then he turned to her and asked her if any among us were carrying a gun. She looked at us and pointed to Jin.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Easy guess. Jin is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; packing heat.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, yeah. But that's not the crazy part. He asked Jin to point his gun at him for a quick demonstration. He, of course, refused, but Kyon-dono insisted and said to not worry about it. Coming from a guy who didn't seek revenge on the little shits that shot at him at the cinema, perhaps he really doesn't think anything of someone taking aim at him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And probably he was wearing a vest, too.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Could be, but the thing is, Jin nodded. I think he was really curious about what the little boss wanted to prove with that. The rest of us took a few steps away from potential line of fire, but neither of them moved. I knew for a fact that Jin uses a shoulder holster under the suit, but he surprised me when he&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;He&amp;hellip;? Get over with it, will you?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hey! I like to put some extra suspense into my stories.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It's annoying.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alright, alright. It went like this: Jin drew a gun from his back. I'm guessing he had an especially built holster strapped there or something. Whatever the case, before I truly realized what was going on, the girl was already next to him and with one of those blink-and-you-miss-it maneuvers she took the gun from him, removed the magazine, emptied the chamber by the ejection port and pressed the barrel against his jaw.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seriously? It sounds like something out of a Jet Li movie.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yeah. The only thing missing was her saying "bang, bang" just to rub it in. For who knows how long everybody just stood there, frozen. The first to move was Kyon-dono, who walked to them, picked up the magazine and the discarded bullet from the floor, handed them to Jin, thanked him for his cooperation and apologized for the inconveniences. He especially stressed the last part while looking at her, so I'm guessing she wasn't supposed to show off &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It's all that&amp;ndash;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The truth? Yes. I was there, remember? My favourite part is when he next asked &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; to put that away, pointing at her hand not holding the gun.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Why?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;She had a combat knife pressed against Jin's gut. No one there, not even the guy himself noticed until Kyon-dono mentioned aloud. The girl &lt;em&gt;giggled&lt;/em&gt; at that, a sound I won't be forgetting for a while, gave Jin his gun back and then she took her post behind Kyon-dono and to his left with a &lt;em&gt;twirl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Is she&amp;hellip;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stab-happy as they come? I don't know for sure and I want to &lt;em&gt;remain&lt;/em&gt; that way in case something happens and people come asking questions. It's known that she gets along very well with Nagato-san, though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Which explains a lot and opens even more questions. I wonder where he does even find these kind of girls.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And how he keeps them loyal. It reminds me of that Indian king who had hundreds of super-elite warrior women watching his back, Chandra-something-or-another in the 300 BC.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises one eyebrow, incredulously*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What? I'm a very well-read person, you know.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises both eyebrows, more incredulously*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip; fine. I read about it once in &lt;a href="http://www.badassoftheweek.com/chandragupta.html"&gt;BadassOfTheWeek.com&lt;/a&gt;. Happy?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That's more like it &lt;em&gt;*finishes his drink*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case it wasn't clear enough, this snippet is a what-if scenario about how un-chibied!Asakura joining the Tsuruya-tachi could go.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the often unnoticed journey between slumber and awareness, Haruhi realized where she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before stirring awake, an instinctive part of her mind recognized a set of heartbeats other than her own. Unhurried and constant. First tempting her to go back to sleep with the wordless promise of a safe rest but now just reminding her of the wide world out there where she has &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; big dreams to make true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruhi opened her eyes and under the dim light of Kyon's bedroom she soon noticed she was snuggled up to his left side, her head resting just below his shoulder and her left arm draped over his midsection. The realization brought a small blush to her face and dispelled the last traces of sleepiness from her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conscious thought quickly asserted itself and previous experiences advised Haruhi that her first task of the day should be to find out how much time she had left before being teleported back home, a question easily enough to answer by the simple action of peering over Kyon's sleeping form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the analog clock on the nightstand revealed that it was just a little earlier than the time she sets her own alarm but Haruhi's attention soon zeroed in on the unexpected sight of an empty space at the other side of the bed. The idea of sharing a bed with Kyon&amp;mdash;and only him&amp;mdash;intensified her blush up to what could be called the "Kanae's zone" of the red spectrum, however something out of the corner of her eye prevented her thoughts from wandering around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, next to the closet's door, the girl with the lavender hair stood still and facing away from the bed. Before Haruhi could call out to her, Yuki seemed to notice her and turned on her heel and walked toward them without making a sound. Only when she was about to get into the bed, Haruhi noticed that Yuki was studiously examining something in her right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What you got there, Yuki?" Haruhi asked as quietly as possible, trusting that Yuki would be able to listen her regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This," Yuki stated and simply held a small object in front of Haruhi in reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the sometimes unforgettable path between observation and realization, Haruhi found the time to stare, tilt her head, rub her eyes, stare again&amp;mdash;agape this time&amp;mdash;, widen her eyes and sputter uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that, Yuki immediately adopted a look that Haruhi learned to associate to "mild admonishment", placed her extended index finger vertically in front of her lips and gestured toward Kyon, a motion that Haruhi observed takes an &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; different connotation than a simple request of silence for the still sleeping young man when the quiet girl holds a &lt;em&gt;freaking condom&lt;/em&gt; with the same hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruhi tried and failed to put her questions into words in a silent manner, a fact that Yuki seemed to catch on and prompted her to take preventive measures, waving her hand and invoking a small display of blue sparks around Kyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have erected a provisional field around him that mitigates the amplitude of the sound waves that may reach him," Yuki explained in her normal tone of voice. "We can now speak freely without the risk of startling him awake."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good thinking, but first: What the hell? Where did you get that?" Haruhi demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Among his belongings. You seem surprised," Yuki commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course I'm surprised! Anyone wo&amp;ndash; Wait, do you even know what that is?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. A prophylactic, also known as condom, is a flexible sleeve made of&amp;ndash;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stop! I get it, you don't have to explain!" Haruhi interrupted and took a few deep breaths to calm herself. "Sorry. It was unexpect&amp;ndash; wait a&amp;ndash; 'among &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; belongings'? Do you mean &lt;em&gt;Kyon's&lt;/em&gt;?!" A calm that proved to be quite short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is correct," Yuki confirmed with a nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ugh&amp;hellip;" Haruhi uttered, making an effort to look at the situation objectively. "Alright, I s-suppose it's to be expected for a g-guy of his age to have one of those things laying around. It's not like he's&amp;ndash;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is not entirely accurate," Yuki corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not&amp;hellip; accurate? W-Which part?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of words, Yuki seem to reconsider something and warped the space above her open left hand, materializing a cardboard box that she handed to Haruhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruhi simpled stared at the new object currently in her hands, focusing for a long moment on the "10 units" label. An obvious scenario slowly but inexorably took form in her mind, but she resisted the temptation to quantify the contents to confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I found this container while looking for&amp;ndash;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait, Yuki. C-Can I ask you something first?" Haruhi cut in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip; You may," Yuki faintly tilted her head and acquiesced with a small nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Was this box&amp;hellip; open when you found it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unopened, anti-tamper seals intact."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruhi let out a sigh she didn't realize she was holding. "Right. Were you saying?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nod. "I found this container while looking for the 'protective gear' that Mori Sonou implied she provided for him to test it and potentially improve it. However, based on the presence of her fingerprints on the surface of the box, my current hypothesis is that she in fact meant this type of contraceptive measures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip;So, Mori-san bought this for Kyon? Why&amp;ndash;? Wait. I think I know what happened," Haruhi all but groaned as she connected the dots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuki's mildly intrigued expression prompted Haruhi to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Er&amp;hellip; Mori-san knows about&amp;hellip; all of us and Kyon, so I think she thought we're&amp;hellip; I mean, we would need the&amp;hellip; stuff if&amp;hellip; Do you get what I'm saying?" Haruhi explained, growing increasingly uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think so. For confirmation: does it mean he did not instruct Mori Sonou to purchase and deliver the package to him?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. I think it was just a misunderstanding on Mori-san's part," Haruhi confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see," Yuki said, her expression shifting to what Haruhi couldn't help but think was &lt;em&gt;disappointment&lt;/em&gt;, but her "Yuki reading" skills weren't so developed yet for her to be certain about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haruhi debated intensely with herself whether she &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to know for sure but Yuki finished her own musings first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I request your insight about something."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure," Haruhi replied, happy for a change of subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Does the fact that he did not try to dispose of this product and instead chose to store it in a concealed location within his bedroom imply he has the intention to use it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question stopped Haruhi's thoughts in their tracks, but before she got a chance to make sense of it someone opened the door and both girls were teleported to their own bedrooms without a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nii-san! Nii-san! Are you awake!" Nonoko loudly cheered and the sudden return of the sound woke up Kyon with a start, prompting him to jump out of the sheets and activate his skinsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cool!" his little sister cooed admiringly at the stunt for a second before remembering why she was there in the first place. "Can I borrow your scissors? I need them for class today!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure. They're in my desk," Kyon said with a yawn once he assessed the situation and deactivated the skinsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thanks!" Nonoko replied before opening a drawer, grabbing the item and walking out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nono-chan, be careful with that while you're walking down the stairs," Yuuto advised his daughter as he reached the door and turned his attention to Kyon. "Good morning, Kyon. Funny not seeing you dressed yet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good morning," Kyon greeted him and glanced at the clock and noticed that he in fact slept in a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, right! Before I forget to ask again. Kyon, are you planing to take the writing exam for a scooter licen&amp;ndash;" Yuuto trailed off, his eyes trained on certain point on the floor. Kyon followed his father's gaze and identified the&amp;hellip; "protection" on the floor, feeling himself blanching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Is that&amp;ndash;?/How&amp;ndash;?"" father and son uttered at the same time and turned to regard each other. After a good ten seconds of locked stares, and to Kyon's surprise, his father was the first to look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Er&amp;hellip;" Yuuto tried before finding his voice. "Stash that away before your mother or your sister see it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon couldn't do more than nodding numbingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Um&amp;hellip; a piece of advice: Make &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt; of storing them properly. Never in your wallet or&amp;hellip;" a cough "or&amp;hellip; the glove compartment of a car. The heat in the cabin is bad for them and&amp;hellip; Well, see you at the table."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon kept nodding, wisely avoiding to say anything that could dispel whatever was keeping his father from lecturing him or asking uncomfortable questions. Once Yuuto left the room and closed the door, Kyon immediately put away the items in their old location and wondered how such ridiculous situation came about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it hit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a pained groan, Kyon prepared himself for a very awkward day at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made so many mistakes with the dialogue tags in the draft of &lt;a href="tvt-kbdh-14028.html"&gt;Zero-Sum Game&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to write a little epilogue of sorts free of double quotation marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Kyon and Sasaki ended their last 'match', it was indeed pretty late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time they walked across the corridors of a Kitago High School devoid of people. Or the fourth time for Kyon, depending on how one may think of alternate dimensions or temporal planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki constantly checked on the condition of her school uniform and her hair to keep other others from figuring out what she and the young man walking briskly at her side just got up to, but she was still too new in the ways of a teenage girl in a relationship to realize that her blush, her occasionally unfocused eyes and her unconscious tendency to move her lips tellingly every 40 seconds or so were dead giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His previous experiences left Kyon in better control of himself, but his expression betrayed his concerns about bringing Sasaki to her home as soon as possible and devising a suitable explanation to give to his parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that his mother didn't try to contact him didn't put him at ease because it implied either that someone, ranging from Tsuruya to his future self, arranged something for the occasion or it was the confirmation that his mother simply assumed that he was in the middle of &lt;em&gt;ninkyo dantai&lt;/em&gt; business to take care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody caught them leaving the premises nor they triggered the silent alarm that the public school actually had in place. Trivialities like disabling a civilian security system without really turning it off weren't even worth for Ryouko to mention aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their cab arrived to the meeting point a few blocks away from the school not even a minute after they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon and Sasaki remained in silence during the whole trip to her house since the moment she gave her address to the driver, most likely because the amused look the forty-something old man gave them when he took in their appearances and his barely contained chortles during all the way there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki almost heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of her house standing dim and silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked her to the door and as he was looking for the proper words to say goodbye, Sasaki unexpectedly laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such a beautiful and unrestrained sound, the kind of wholehearted expression that she rarely allowed to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon stood there, dumbfounded, until the moment she turned her face lit with mirth to him. In her eyes he understood the source of her amusement and joined her in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just too ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her. A sixteen years old girl who was kidnapped by the freaking &lt;em&gt;yakuza&lt;/em&gt; more times than she bothered to count. Someone who was pursuing a long-term romantic relationship with the boy at her side together with &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; other girls. Someone who was just &lt;em&gt;beginning&lt;/em&gt; to understand how vast and impossible the universe really was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him. A seventeen years old boy who was already a high-ranked and well-respected member of the biggest crime syndicate in Japan. Someone who prevented the end of the world as we know it several times over. Someone who plays a pivotal role in the doings of time-travelers, human aliens, espers, sliders, cosmic entities and reality warpers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also were a silly girl-and-boy pair getting worked up over breaking curfew because they lost track of the time while making out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took them several minutes to regain control over themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then when Kyon found the words he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without making a sound, he drew himself closer to her, gently turned her head toward his and kissed her softly on the lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They let the kiss linger until Sasaki's mother decided that she observed enough and turned on the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Ryouko didn't fail to record the moment for later perusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost sure I'm stealing this whole idea from somewhere, but for the life of me I can't remember where.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="tvtropes"></category><category term="snippet"></category><category term="waff"></category></entry><entry><title>Zero-Sum Game</title><link href="http://specularreflection.github.io/idle/tvt-kbdh-14028.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-26T19:48:36-04:00</updated><author><name>Specular</name></author><id>tag:specularreflection.github.io,2013-06-26:idle/tvt-kbdh-14028.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=3m4uvlo3cr9ksrpsdzmzhd78&amp;amp;page=562#14028"&gt;[Source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week following the first official visit of the SOS Brigade to Hinamizawa was also its newest member's first week in her new school and it only took one trip for the near northern solstice's sun to burn into Sasaki the certainty that only a moron or a sadist builds a school at the top a hill without taking into account public transportation's routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of her efforts, her discomfort didn't go unnoticed by her friends, who decided that some compensation was in order and after considering that Sasaki never took part of the Brigade's or practically any other non-academic after-school activity, they thought it would be nice if she enjoyed the usufruct of the clubroom for a few hours after class as she saw fit with Kyon appointed as her official escort for not-so-alleged security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did a hopelessly in love sixteen-years-old girl get up to alone with her boyfriend in a perfectly soundproofed room?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and chatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Mikuru thought it was sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't like Sasaki actually missed the implied meaning behind her friends' antics, but she had her reasons to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before they became friends, one of the first things that caught her eye about Kyon in middle school was his ability to seemingly effortlessly come up with solid tactics when he played with their classmates, yet the two of them never got the opportunity to play a strategy game before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cram school forbade any kind of &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames"&gt;tabletop games&lt;/a&gt; and their lunch breaks ended up being better spent in conversation. Not even the occasional study sessions at either of their homes gave them that chance because neither of their &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama"&gt;education-oriented mothers&lt;/a&gt; was capable of checking on them at intervals longer than eight minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real reason for such scrutiny passed way over Kyon's &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove"&gt;oblivious-to-romance&lt;/a&gt; head, but Sasaki couldn't help but feel a little mortified that both women expected that kind of hormonal behavior from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Sasaki wasn't sure if it was a change for the worse or for the better when Kyon somehow managed to get on her mother's good side, turning any apprehensive feeling the latter could have about her daughter's best male friend into annoyingly enthusiastic approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now her chagrin had an entirely new source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth game. Black's 27th move. Checkmate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above defeat was Sasaki's best result to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was amazing in a way that only makes sense if you're at the other side of the board. The way how your almost every plan falls apart in its first or second stage at most, with the only exceptions being when you're walking into a trap and you haven't realize it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No bragging. No mercy. No effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was what Kyon offered as an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki didn't know it yet, but this was part of the reason why Koizumi Itsuki persisted in trying to triumph over Kyon in such games, only to fail every time. For him, there was something comforting about the fact that Suzumiya Haruhi's &lt;em&gt;chosen one&lt;/em&gt; couldn't be defeated by a ploy of his making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth game was also the moment Sasaki realized why Haruhi jokingly warned her against playing "&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StripPoker"&gt;strip-chess&lt;/a&gt;" the moment the supreme commander heard of her plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether inadvertently following her friend's advice was something to be grateful for or not, it was a question Sasaki preferred to leave unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most annoying part was that Kyon barely took notice of the board, busying himself instead with his narration of some of the ordinary, publicly known stories about the SOS Brigade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the one about Haruhi and Yuki serving as stand-ins for a girl band called &lt;em&gt;ENOZ&lt;/em&gt; during the last &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival"&gt;cultural festival&lt;/a&gt; caught her attention. Especially after he almost made her promise to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; encourage Haruhi about forming a band with the Brigade members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I never knew you were so skilled at chess. You must have practiced a lot," Sasaki commented, once more placing the pieces back into their initial formation and switching their sides' color. She suspected that said action was the only reason why he hadn't thought of putting the board away yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not really. Koizumi brought the game to the clubroom last year a little after &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanabata"&gt;Tanabata&lt;/a&gt; and needed someone to play with him, so I learned the rules. In hindsight we never played much, but lately it seems that Yuki-chan took a liking to chess and &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shogi"&gt;shogi&lt;/a&gt; and invites me to play with her," Kyon replied and opened their seventh game by advancing one of his white pawns two squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see. How do fare against her?" she asked as she completed her turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure. I think she tends to win in chess more, roughly in the same proportion I do in shogi," Kyon guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, under the assumption Nagato-san is equally good at both games, it follows you're a better at shogi than chess?" Sasaki posited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Probably. Uncle Keiichi taught me how to play when I was twelve, so I have more experience with the former."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your uncle?" she voiced a little incredulously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah. Neither he or Auntie Satoko are what we can call your stereotypical shogi players, but for some reason they were playing a lot during that &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseHolidays"&gt;Golden Week&lt;/a&gt;," Kyon agreed. "They even made a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliatingWager"&gt;punishment game&lt;/a&gt; out of it where the loser had to shout whatever the winner wanted."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seriously?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely. All my aunts and uncles are avid tabletop gamers and they like to bet anything other than money or goods, punishment games being their favourite choice when they have the chance. I think they even made a club in high school devoted to that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How unique. Back to the topic, I gather you learned the game from observing your uncle and aunt?" Sasaki asked and for some reason Kyon looked a little embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To be completely honest, I was just hiding from Matsuri-chan. She was six or seven at the time and I was a little tired of her following me everywhere. Thankfully Uncle Keiichi was losing almost consistently and she ran away after Auntie Satoko made him shout 'Matsu-chan, I LUV U!!!!!!', so I considered that staying next to him was the best option," Kyon said, somehow managing to deadpan even that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki couldn't help but giggle a little at both the story and his narration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now that I think about it, something happened after that," Kyon mused aloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Er, well. It's a bit of a long story. Do you mind?" If he was surprised at Sasaki's question, Kyon didn't delve into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not at all!" Sasaki encouraged after glancing the board one last time and deciding she could forget about winning that match too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OK, then. Where was I&amp;hellip;? Right. If I recall correctly, Auntie Satoko went to check on the other kids and I needed an excuse to remain there, so I asked my uncle to teach me to play. He explained to me about the pieces, their movement, promotions, drops, etc. He said it was easier to learn shogi by playing and I followed his lead," Kyon related slowly, absently toying with the black bishop in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He won the first two matches but by the third I could remember all the rules and managed to win twice. From what I could tell, his greatest weakness in shogi was that he had problems constraining his ideas to a rigid, small set of rules. He came up with and discarded tactics on the fly before they could give him any definite advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's interesting," Sasaki commented, actually referring to Kyon's insightfulness rather than his assessment by itself. "How did you best him then?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I played simply, an obvious yet efficient strategy. His pieces were too disorganized to stop it. I remember when Auntie Satoko came back and Uncle Keiichi mimicked being shot in the heart and said 'you defeated the first Dark General, young hero. But the next one will be stronger!' Then he took my aunt by the shoulders and made her sit in front of the board," Kyon reminisced with some fondness yet still kept the deadpan on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What happened next?" she prompted him to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We played. I lost the first game soundly. Auntie Satoko's style was completely different from my uncle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How would you describe it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip; If I have to describe her in a word as a shogi player, I'd go for 'trickster'. She mounted traps inside traps surrounded by traps and even if you avoid one, you could be setting another one off. Anyway, even though she won, Auntie Satoko was very surprised when my uncle told her that technically that game was my fifth one. We played two more times, a draw and a victory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did you win?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. You see, traps are inherently reactive. Except as a deterrent, the enemy needs to actually trigger it for a trap to accomplish anything. So Iâ€¦ how was it? 'lured the tiger out of the mountain'?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThirtySixStratagems"&gt;The Thirty-Six Stratagems&lt;/a&gt;?" Sasaki recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's the book," Kyon nodded nonplussed, having long got used to Sasaki's extensive academic knowledge. "Auntie Satoko is not a patient person, so when I played defensively she soon charged in, losing numbers with each exchange. It didn't take long before she had too few pieces on the board to play as she was used to and then I attacked."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's amazing," she said sincerely. "You must have been very happy then to be able to defeat two grown-ups in a row."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Actually, I didn't care too much about that. I was more worried about the fact that, without Uncle Keiichi yelling embarrassing things, Matsuri-chan would return sooner than latter. That's why I got behind his idea of me fighting the 'Third Dark General' and I followed him to Auntie Rena's house."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How was she?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think the whole thing about the 'Four Dark Generals' predated me by a long shot because what Haruhi calls the '&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil"&gt;Sorting Algorithm of Evil&lt;/a&gt;' was in full effect," he said. Sasaki didn't know the term, but she guessed it meant something along the lines of 'the next rival will be stronger than the one before.' "She was&amp;hellip; a difficult opponent," Kyon worded slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would think so. From her books you can tell she is a very creative and intelligent person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did you read them?" Kyon asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just the first one of the &lt;em&gt;Brave Detective Sasha&lt;/em&gt; series yesterday. For some reason my mother owns a collection of the first six books. But tell me, how did you fare against Ryuguu-san?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One draw, one victory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You won?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, but I had to almost cheat to pull it off. It took me the half of the first match to figure out that her game wasn't on the board."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you mean?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Auntie Rena was very apt at predicting my movements and counter them, but she wasn't reading them from my game. She was reading &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; instead."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Like a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker"&gt;poker&lt;/a&gt; player?" Sasaki suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly. The problem was I had no idea what my 'tells' were or how to keep her from reading them. If I tried something, she most likely would see through the deception," Kyon related and crossed his arms, still holding the black bishop in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How did you defeat her then?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Have you ever seen a traditional shogi board? The one we had then was as big as a nightstand's drawer," he asked suddenly and pantomimed the board's dimensions with his hands. "And it included two little pedestals that the players set at their right side of the board to place the captured pieces on. Or the other side if you're left-handed, I suppose," Kyon said the last bit almost to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Actually I have, but&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm getting there. The thing is that the only way to trick her I could come up with then was to fool myself first."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki was genuinely intrigued at Kyon's vague clues. For his part, Kyon couldn't help but think that her curious expression, with her head slightly tilted to the side and her pensive face, was in fact quite cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"During the second match, I captured one of her &lt;em&gt;gin&lt;/em&gt; (silver general) early in the game, but I didn't place it on the pedestal. Instead&amp;hellip;" He called her attention to the black piece held now between his index and middle finger. "&amp;hellip;I left it behind the board from her point of view." He hid the bishop from her eyes by setting it down on the table and behind his open right hand, which was laid on its side with its back toward her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then, I made myself forget about it," he finished, saying that as though he thought it was explanation enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What." Sasaki's flat tone conveyed that she didn't agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I mean, it was like I was trying to convince myself of stuff like: 'the gin wasn't there', 'it wasn't mine', 'I didn't capture it', 'it was somebody else's problem', 'what was that thing about a gin again?', etc. Just forgoing the silly mantra."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How does&amp;ndash;?" Sasaki interrupted herself once she remembered about the 'dropping' rule in shogi and realized the incredible mix of guile and naivetÃ© (a lot more of the latter than the former, in her opinion) in young Kyon's plan. "You are kidding, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In my defense, I didn't really expect it to work. As you already guessed, we continued playing and Auntie Rena kept predicting my moves. By the endgame, when we were heading to a second tie, I spent a turn putting the gin back on the board. It completely blindsided her and the checkmate came two turns later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki confirmed her misgivings: Yes, cute lil' twelve years old Kyon somehow weaponized his own willful ignorance and placed an auto-suggestion on himself to make Rena's own superior perspicacity work against her. What the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did you ever meet the 'fourth dark general'?" Sasaki asked after shaking her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, during that same visit to Hinamizawa. The last 'Dark General': Auntie Mion. She was something else entirely, hands down."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did your uncle take you to play with her?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was a little more convoluted than that. It was almost dinnertime after the second match against Auntie Rena and, with the exception of Auntie Mion who was in Okinomiya at the time, we all dined at the Fuurude house," Kyon elaborated and glanced through the clubroom window for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There my uncle 'revealed' to her that it was my first day playing shogi and, unless I'm missing my mark, they were more proud at the fact I tricked Auntie Rena than just the game's result," he said and turned his eyes to the face of the analog clock hanging on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After we finished our meal, the self-appointed 'Three Mighty Dark Generals' hunched together like rugby players next to the table and held a whispered emergency meeting. Stage whispered, I mean," Kyon finally added, bringing his attention back to Sasaki again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She blinked at the mental image. He simply sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From what I gathered from the pieces of conversation I could hear while I helped Auntie Rika carry the dirty dishes to the sink, they were discussing my chances against the fourth of them. Apparently Auntie Rena couldn't answer Uncle Keiichi's question about if I was 'really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good' at shogi or in fact a 'Mi-chan-class' player."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That'sâ€¦ good, I guess. It mean you really impressed them," Sasaki commented tentatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The truth was Uncle Keiichi was plotting something and my aunts liked what he was thinking. If someday I see the three of them turning as one to look at me with matching smirks like that, I will run away. No question asked," Kyon nodded to himself and imparted his hard-earned wisdom. "I must admit it was strangely satisfying when Auntie Rika broke the moment by covering his head with a cloth and telling him it was his turn to wash the dishes, though." he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anyway, a few days later I managed to forget about it and I didn't delve too much into it when Auntie Satoko took me to the Sonozaki house and left my sister in Auntie Rena's care. When we were close enough to the main building, I heard Uncle Keiichi and Auntie Mion's voices. Because of the distance I couldn't discern what they were saying, but it was obvious that they were speaking quite loudly to each other. At my side my aunt apparently could tell more and just grinned."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did he&amp;hellip;?" Sasaki ventured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's right. We entered the house through the sliding doors facing the yard and I realized then that my uncle and aunt were in fact trash-talking, with him just finishing a flowery speech about how '&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion"&gt;his champion&lt;/a&gt;' will 'teach her what strategy is really about'." Kyon shook his head disapprovingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No pressures, I see," Sasaki quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It gets worse. After we arrived to the living room where Auntie Mion, Auntie Rika and Uncle Keiichi waited, I was forced to deeply empathize with Matsuri-chan."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you mean?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uncle Keiichi was dressed up as my personal one-man-&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cendan"&gt;ouendan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (cheerleader squad) with the gakuran, headband, plastic megaphone&amp;hellip;" Kyon recalled with an uncomfortable expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're making that up," she deadpanned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wish. Apparently the costume and pictures of him wearing it was what Auntie Rena demanded for watching over the children that evening. Later he told me that he got lucky with the get-up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What did he mean?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He said it was at least a &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; cheerleader outfit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the moment when Sasaki's brain betrayed her by dutifully providing her with the relevant mental images. Some of Kyon's narration was lost to her while she suppressed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip; then he gave me an embarrassing motivational speech and I decided that it was for the best if I tuned him out and devoted my focus to the game." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki decided she should follow suit. "How did it go?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, we had rules of engagement this time: 1) There will be three matches. 2) The winner is decided by points. 3) Wins score 3 points each. No points for draws, forfeits or defeats. 4) As a handicap in my favor, my wins score 2 additional points." Kyon punctuated each rule with a finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki quickly ran some numbers in her head and realized that under such rules Kyon needed at least a win and a draw to be the winner. Any other case sans 3 draws in a row would mean Mion's victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's getting kind of late," Kyon stated abruptly. "Should I continue now or we&amp;ndash;?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would like to hear what happened in your three matches against Sonozaki-san. Was she as good as your aunts and uncle suggested?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Better. It was like playing against Yuki-chan or the hardest levels of chess in Skynet." Kyon motioned to his phone. A certain blue-haired interface got a self-satisfied smile at that, but as she wasn't currently projecting herself in the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AugmentedReality"&gt;AR&lt;/a&gt; environment, neither of the humans in the room noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, at the time it was my first time against someone that good. I think I wouldn't do her game justice if I try to put it into words. The adaptability, the decisiveness, the resourcefulness. I was so impressed that when I lost the first match I couldn't bring myself to care. I just wanted to keep playing but I wasn't even thinking about wanting to keep playing&amp;hellip;" Kyon reminisced with unusual intensity. "Sasaki, have you ever been 'in the zone' before?" he asked her suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you mean that state of absolute concentration?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's the one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not personally, but I read a little about it. Formally, it's called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29"&gt;'flow'&lt;/a&gt; and it's described as a mental state of operation where immersion, involvement and enjoyment are fully devoted to the activity at hand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think that was what happened to me. Somehow, I started to unravel every single element composing her strategy and more importantly how each of them fit together. The harder she played, the quicker I understood. I vaguely remember my aunts' surprised faces when the second match ended in a stalemate or my uncle's cheers getting louder. I just picked up the pieces and prepared the board to play again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Kyon was telling his story almost to himself. Sasaki remained quiet for the time being, observing him carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then, during the third match, Auntie Mion made a mistake. Not a feint nor a bait like several times before. Just a blunder. I won't say I managed to force her to that, but I didn't hesitate to capitalize on it. Two turns later she realized it together with the fact it would cost her the match. Then&amp;hellip; something unexpected happened," he trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What was it?" Sasaki prompted after several seconds of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She blushed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon's words came as a non sequitur for Sasaki. "What?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Auntie Mion blushed and that brought my attention out of the board but for some reason I remained in that 'flow state'. I looked at her and I observed she was also stealing glances at my uncle, growing uncomfortable. Then, somehow, it was like the board expanded to envelop us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything that it happened in the last few days, especially the last two and a half hours of gaming, came together. It was obvious, really: Uncle Keiichi and Auntie Mion made a bet on the result of our little tournament and whatever the payment was, it was something very embarrassing. Apparently both wagered the same thing because I heard them say something along the lines of 'Same stakes, no pulling back, no excuses from the loser.' just before Auntie Satoko and I arrived to the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was then when I realized I could remember a lot of things I supposedly didn't pay attention to and another fact became evident: Auntie Satoko and Auntie Rena wanted Uncle Keiichi to lose. The former was laughing with that trademark &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoblewomansLaugh"&gt;'ohhhh, ho-ho-ho'&lt;/a&gt; of hers during the first match, but that diminished a lot during the second one and now she was simply trying to assess the situation on the shogi board without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On the other hand, the latter must have known from the beginning that no matter how much of a knack for shogi a twelve years old boy could have, he simply was no match against someone at Auntie Mion's level. Probably the two of them hyped my skills to Uncle Keiichi so he would dare to make a bet in the first place. There was also the detail that none of them tried to practice with me during the in-between days in preparation for the match, even if Auntie Rena was the one who got more chances to do it because my sister and I spent a day in her house playing with Yurie-chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For her part, Auntie Mion didn't hold back one bit against me from the start. During the first match, most of the respite I got came from the fact she was still studying me. Her attitude then was the complete opposite of her usual policy of losing on purpose but not too obviously against children, which is something I learned from her and I still do when I play with my sister and cousins."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki couldn't help but notice he was ignoring one of the most obvious oddities there: he was actually &lt;em&gt;winning&lt;/em&gt; against Mion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It didn't bother me that they cast me to play the role of the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn"&gt;unwitting pawn&lt;/a&gt; of their games. It was, after all, just that: a silly bet. But all that deviated my thoughts from 'how' to play more towards 'why' or 'what for' I should do it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon reached out his right hand, took his white bishop from the chessboard and presented both identical yet color-mirrored pieces to Sasaki with both of his palms up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sunset sun illuminated the clubroom through the window and the lower spectrum of the light visible at that hour bathed his visage with orange tones and sharp shadows. Because of that, even his usual, somewhat tired posture acquired a fraction of the gravitas one would expect from a person whose actions and decisions affect the fate of one or more worlds, preventing Sasaki from saying anything or even turning her eyes away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If I decided to win the third match," Kyon posited while raising the hand holding the black chess piece. "The score would be 5-3 to my favor and Auntie Mion would have to pay her bet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On the other hand," he lowered his left arm at the same time and speed he raised his right one, as if pantomiming the plates of a weighing scale. "If I forfeited or either proposed or forced a draw, the outcome would be a 0-3 and Uncle Keiichi would lose." He then left both palms at the same level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you think I did?" Kyon suddenly asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His question broke the spell and Sasaki realized he was looking at her curiously, as if wondering what was going on with her but refraining from asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Er&amp;hellip; I-I think you won, right? The way you say it makes look like Fuurude-san was played into losing his bet. Furthermore, if you had such a high opinion of Sonozaki-san's skills, then it just natural you wanted to prove yourself before her," Sasaki conjectured and decided that it was a good idea to occupy herself and put away the chessboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she just turned the foldable board upside-down and she was about to place the first pieces inside, Kyon smiled at her and simply stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nobody won that bet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait. That's impossible," Sasaki's analytical mind spoke in her place before she could put too much intention on it. "The two outcomes you just described are the only possible ones."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's correct, but when it came down to it, I just didn't want that either Uncle Keiichi or Auntie Mion to have to lose. So I &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption"&gt;took a third option&lt;/a&gt; and resorted to the biggest asset I had."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What was that?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact I was a twelve years old kid who wasn't told anything about the wager by anyone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip; what? How?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Allow me to explain. In that moment, Auntie Mion and I were the only ones who knew she was going to lose, to anyone else it was still an ongoing match, but &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow"&gt;she wasn't aware I was sure of it and the fact she realized that&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Sasaki was a little confused too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To accomplish what I wanted, I needed to get rid of something first and to do it I put on my best I-know-nothing face, the kind of expression that served me well in the past to save my sister from my mother's ire, and I asked 'How many points did I get for the last match?'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, Kyon seemed to think that was explanation enough. This time he realized on his own that Sasaki wanted him to elaborate further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Auntie Satoko pointed out that draws scored no points and asked me if I remembered the rules. I told her something along the lines of 'of course, the winner is the best of three matches'. Auntie Rika then repeated the rules one by one and when she mentioned the fourth rule, the one about the handicap, I frowned and told them I didn't need one."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki blinked as the pieces of puzzle begun to fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I took the best lessons of my sister's book about petulant kids. I crossed my arms, pouted a little and surly told them that a boy doesn't need or want handicaps in a competition against a girl and that I wasn't going to play anymore if that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Normally, my aunts and uncles are very serious about their games' rules and they won't bend them in the middle of a match, especially if there was bet in play, but I wasn't one of them and I wasn't supposed to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; a thing about a bet in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uncle Keiichi was the only one with something to lose if we removed the handicap, therefore the one only one with strong reasons to oppose, but he started to warm to the idea when I let slip something close to 'a man should set and live by his own rules'. By then, probably he also started to think that it was unlikely I would get a clean victory over Auntie Mion. In the end, they granted my wish."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, one can infer that the last match&amp;hellip;?" Sasaki deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. It was my win and the final score was 3-3. Although, I had to put on a proper show and prolong the match as much as possible to avoid suspicions. Because of that and the looks I got from Auntie Mion, I'm sure she figured out something." Kyon shrugged as implying that there are no perfect plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did you ever tell them anything about this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I didn't and only once someone asked me about it. It happened that very same night."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Who? Sonozaki-san?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Auntie Rika. She volunteered to take me back to her house and once we were alone she asked me, point-blank, why I refused to win."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What did you tell her?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I tried to play dumb and reuse the 'handicaps are for sissies' excuse, but then she got a very serious and dignified expression, stared down at me and asked the same question again. It was very intimidating to me then, she was taller and I tend to forget she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko"&gt;miko&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the shrine dedicated to Oyashiro-sama," Kyon said while staring fixedly at the clubroom's long table from his seated position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the longest time I couldn't figure out why she did that, why she wanted to know my reasons that badly. Because I'm sure she didn't care one bit about how I knew about the bet or anything else, really. Finally, I told her what I said to you and then she smiled in a way she never did in front of me before."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pardon me, what was it again?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My think my words were 'I was enjoying the game, so I just didn't want anyone to have to lose'. Anyway, a few minutes later I took advantage of her good mood and asked what Uncle Keiichi and Auntie Mion gambled on the game for them to want to avoid losing that badly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I must confess I'm curious too. Did she tell you?" Sasaki admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She got very uncomfortable and after pestering her a little she only said I was too young to know. I have a theory, though."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think the loser was supposed to wear a police or perhaps a prisoner cosplay," Kyon unexpectedly suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An embarrassing outfit sounds like a likely possibility, buy why do you think it's that, specifically?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because I'm sure I heard Auntie Satoko whispering something about padded handcuffs at some point during the second match against Auntie Mion. I mean, no other costume needs that kind of props, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki decided it was an excellent time to finally put away those chess pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also, considering what we know now about &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza"&gt;their job&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense for them to be reluctant to dress up like that." Kyon obliviously nodded to himself. For her part, Sasaki studiously pretended to agree with him and mirrored the gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Would you give your analysis about my game?" Sasaki suddenly requested, looking for a way to escape from her treacherous brain and its unwanted mental images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My analysis?" he parroted, unsure of what she meant by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. Like you did with Fuurude-san and Houjou-san about shogi. What would you say are my weaknesses on the chessboard?" she elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh," Kyon uttered and thought to himself for a moment. "You aimed too hard for an all-encompassing solution, working on every little detail of your strategy. There is nothing wrong with that by itself, but in a practical situation you're giving your opponent the opportunity to figure out your overall plans at the same time you're building them," he finally said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki considered his assessment for a little while. "Your advice?" she enquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need to progress in your long-term goals at the same time you reap the benefits of achieving the short-term ones, to know where you want to go without planning on your every step there from the start," Kyon suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl wearing Kitago's uniform stopped her movements for a moment and almost imperceptibly widened her eyes. Then she resumed her self-imposed duty of transferring chess pieces from the table to the inverted side of the foldable chessboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What about your weaknesses, then?" Sasaki asked, walking around the table and dragging the board with her, picking up along the way the few pieces that rolled across it to the end of the furniture and putting them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have a lot of them to pick. For example, I'm weak against surprise attacks as the next person." Kyon motioned as if to stand and store by himself the two bishops he was still holding in his hands, Sasaki gestured him to stay on his seat and she reached out with both hands to take the pieces from his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It especially confuses me when an enemy charges in without too much of a chance of victory, as though they expect to be overwhelmed and just want&amp;ndash;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when Sasaki suddenly grabbed his hands instead of the bishops, pulled herself towards him and sat on his lap in one smooth motion. By the time the symmetrical chess pieces hit the floor and rolled away, she already had her arms around his neck and she was kissing him full on the lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely he was the only one who didn't see that one coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for the record, the Hinamizawa local rule about a punishment game that ends tied is that everyone who didn't win must pay their bets, as it was the case when Rena and Keiichi won together the 'life-or-death' squirt-gun battle and Mion, Satoko and Rika had to follow their orders or the time where the whole club had to parade across the town while wearing cosplay and ended walking toward that quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to the troper Silver, who went "all editorial on" that ugly thing I dared to call "draft".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's change a little something of Chapter 47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He intended to arrive early to the office that morning. The Daitokuji account needed to be settled by the end of the day and there was still a lot of work left to do before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even went to bed early the night before and managed to wake up 45 minutes earlier than the usual. The lighter traffic would allow him to add other thirty minutes to his early start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started well enough. His suit and briefcase were already prepared and more than fifteen years of practice allowed Yuuto to disentangle from his cuddling wife with very little fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, anyone but him would need to read that sentence twice or thrice before pretending it never happened. Also it would surprise people to the point of willful (or in one case, alcohol-assisted) amnesia just to have an inkling of how different her personality was on the very rare occasions when they were alone and their two children were staying over elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Yuuto walked to the kitchen across a silent house with the day's clothes folded over his arm, turned on the coffeemaker and then hurried up to take a quick shower. The running cold water helped him to put his ideas in order and the breakfast was spend checking his emails for changes on today's work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was about to grab his car's keys, his mind drifted to thoughts of his daughter. During dinner it was obvious enough from her uncharacteristic dispirited mood that a cold managed to catch up with her. Glancing at his watch, Yuuto decided that he could afford the time to go upstairs and check on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was careful to open the door to her room as quietly as possible and this should have been pretty much the end of it. However this time around, Nonoko actually took notice of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kyon-kun? Is that you?" Yuuto couldn't help but chuckle a little at that. As most older brothers he knew, Kyon wasn't really appreciative of little kid sister's unmitigated fondness of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Try again, Nono-chan." He left his briefcase next to the door and walked to the side of her bed without turning on the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the signs weren't very good. Nonoko's breath was a little labored and she was sweating a lot. Yuuto slowly caressed her forehead to check her temperature and her fever was evident enough that he didn't need to look for the thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cold hand&amp;hellip; feels good," she said weakly, inclining more of her head to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How are you feeling?" Yuuto asked while fumbling with his phone in his left hand. He knew that Akane didn't like to wake up at the sound of her cellphone, but leaving Nonoko alone wasn't an option now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thirsty. I dreamed I was a magical girl." The father of two could only sigh at that. You can't blame a feverish kid for not knowing what information is really relevant in such a state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, really?" he prompted as he dialed his wife's number again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes! I helped Kyon to defeat a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl"&gt;Dark Magical Girl&lt;/a&gt;! Well, I wanted to defeat her but&amp;hellip;" she coughed a few times before getting back her voice. "&amp;hellip; he wanted to befriend her. So I was nice with her&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait for a moment, Nono-chan. Dear? It's me. I'm in Nono-chan's room and her cold got worse. She got a fever and I don't know where her medicine is. Could you come up?" Yuuto quickly informed Akane. Her sudden shift in her voice from sleep to wakefulness told him that she would be there very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip; and then he broke her &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; with a kiss!" Nonoko finished her unheard tale as enthusiastically as she could under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's amazing. I didn't know Kyon's kisses had that much power in them." He pretended to have followed the narration of her oneiric experience while he checked if her pajamas needed to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course they do. It's a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKiss"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKiss"&gt;kiss&lt;/a&gt;!" Resisting the urge to laugh openly, Yuuto gazed at the door at the precise moment Akane walked through it. She greeted with him a nod then turned her attention to their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Does it hurt somewhere, Nono-chan?" she asked as she uncased the digital thermometer from its plastic container and turned it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My stomach hurts and my head feels funny. I'm very thirsty too" Akane placed the device under Nonoko's armpit and then patted her own left wrist twice with index and middle fingers while giving her husband a meaningful glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Something else?" Yuuto enquired Nonoko, acknowledging Akane's unvoiced question about the time with a nod and started to walk towards his briefcase by the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ceiling is taller." His little chagrin at the fact that the small girl could give proper answers to her mom was undeniable, but he could take comfort from the fact that the last one apparently was also a symptom of high fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can you send Kyon to fetch some clean washcloths and a bag of ice before you leave?" Akane said when he was about to exit the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Got it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had he had more time that morning, Yuuto would surely have not stepped into his son's room without knocking. The fact that, in Yuuto's knowledge, Kyon until just recently was most definitely &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAMorningPerson"&gt;not a morning person&lt;/a&gt; didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that his vision was half-adapted to the dark by then helped even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth was that Yuuto would remember the next couple of minutes for years to come. After all, it's not everyday a father opens a door to unexpectedly find his son and his fiancÃ©e in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That still sounds common enough. Let's try again: It's not everyday a father opens a door to unexpectedly find his son half-laying over a girl and kissing her awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite there yet. One more time: It's not everyday a father opens a door to find his son and his fiancÃ©e in bed with him half-laying over &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; girl and kissing the latter awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, third time's a charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Yuuto's briefcase hit the floor, Tsuruya and Kyon learned that, no matter how much training to handle dire and sudden crises a person may receive, they're still human and instincts are indeed a very powerful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the heiress of biggest and most influent ninkyo dantai family in the city was frozen still at the left side of the bed, in a pose that Japanese photographers call &lt;em&gt;wariza&lt;/em&gt; (å‰²åº§) or sometimes &lt;em&gt;onna-no-ko-zuwari&lt;/em&gt; (girl's sitting). Her arms remained where their attempt to tie the right half of her long green hair left them and the almost completed bun became undone, hanging around the white yukata she used as sleepwear that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her face was quite a sight. Probably no one &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; saw her eyes widen like that before, with an expression that suggested that absolutely no thought went through her mind during that instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Kyon, a young man with more than fifty years of dedicated martial arts training under the belt before his seventeenth birthday, succumbed to a primal portion of his brain that told him that if he remained quiet and very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; still, he would go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her part the brown-haired girl partially hidden from the door's point of view simply put a hand behind Kyon's head and pulled him more heavily into the kiss. His lack of response granted a whining overtone to her soft moans but she didn't actually &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; until Yuuto's felt the need to clear his throat just to make a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Yuuto, God bless his acute sense of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas another father would feel righteous outrage at his teenage son's gall, he instead thought of defusing a very volatile situation. Whereas others would seek a suitable punishment, he sought to spare his son from such at his mother's hands. Whereas lesser men would let their outcries to be heard, he only whispered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kyon, get them out of here while I stall your mother in Nono-chan's room. Then get clean washcloths and the bag of ice and take them there. Hurry."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple orders outlining a most suitable plan for an explosive predicament like theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yuuto, is Kyon awake?" Akane's pressing, and more importantly &lt;em&gt;approaching&lt;/em&gt;, voice asked. Predictably, that got everybody to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon performed an impressive maneuver where he got out of his prone position by placing an arm to each side of the girl beneath him and pushing himself up, somehow twisting his body midair and landing on his two feet at the foot of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsuruya turned around and not quite &lt;em&gt;dived&lt;/em&gt; for the small closet in Kyon's room, barely managing to get between all those expensive suits that Kyon recently got and closed the door. Yuuto was pleased to notice that she at least was smart enough to not try to empty it first as it would have been a telltale hint with the room as tidy as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyon's father didn't see what the other girl attempted, but whatever it was he prayed for her to get it done &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The by-now strong candidate for the title of "father of the year" tried to get between his wife and the door, but the worried mother was so focused checking the expiration date of the antipyretic medicine in her hand that she absently &lt;em&gt;dodged&lt;/em&gt; him with a side step and walked into the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned again and tried instead to place a hand on her shoulder so he could make her to look at him before it was too late. To his surprise, only mother and son were present within the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kyon, did your father tell you t&amp;ndash;? Are you alright? Your face is very red. Don't tell me you caught Nonoko's cold and you also woke up burning hot and bathed in sweat."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuuto couldn't help but mentally remark how close to the mark her words were. He also crossed his fingers so that nobody would upset the bedclothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm OK, Mom. I'll get the things Dad asked for." Kyon was quick to reassure with a placating gesture and tried to get to the door, ostensibly to get his mother to follow him outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Give me your forehead first," Akane ordered, reaching for Kyon's head to check his temperature by touching foreheads. Kyon was even quicker to lower himself to her level so she would not have to look up to him. The gesture caught Yuuto's attention and a sudden inspiration made him look up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a term in climbing related sports called "stem". It can refer to two things: a) The simultaneous use of two widely spaced footholds, and b) Climbing using two faces that are at an angle less than 180&amp;deg; to each other. Neither accurately described the awkward posture that inexplicably kept brown-haired girl's back glued to the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She placed her soles in two adjacent walls, her legs extended forming a 90&amp;deg; angle. Her hands firmly grasped the lights' socket and some other invisible fixture on the ceiling. Some autonomous part of Yuuto's mind idly mused that her physical condition must be top-notch to pull off a stunt like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, her sleepwear was modest enough, a short-sleeved shirt and knee-length pants both apparently of Chinese design, otherwise "awkward" wouldn't have had the proper connotation to describe this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yuuto wasn't looking, Kyon was successful in leading his mother out of the room. He picked up his briefcase and followed suit. Trusting the threesomeâ€¦ erâ€¦ group of three teens had the situation in hand, he said his goodbyes and left for work, lest Akane become suspicious because of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trek to car was an atypically slow one. Yuuto strained his hearing, hoping to not perceive an unmistakable call to run damage control. Once outside the house, he instead paid attention to the upper floor's windows. There was light on Nonoko's room now and Kyon's window was open, but that was all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After releasing a long sigh, he sat behind the wheel, started the engine and drove to the office. He hoped that his preferred activity of his youth would work its magic and soothe his frayed nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Excuse me," a completely unexpected female voice said in a somewhat contrite tone. Yuuto's surprise was big enough that he went against his better judgement and turned his head around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the two girls he walked into in less than ideal circumstances that morning were in the car and for some reason the heiress was laying lengthways on backseat with the young acrobat holding her as if she was until just recently carrying the former in her arms bridal-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry car horns broke the moment and remembered Yuuto to pay attention to the road. The last thing they needed was to be pulled over by the cops and have to explain them why a thirty-three years old man was driving two unrelated high school girls in their pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brown-haired girl got her bearings back first and asked "Can I have your phone?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure, it's in the coat," Yuuto replied. The green-haired girl had better access to the outer garment and handed the appliance to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, there is a cosmic law that demands that any prolonged awkward moment must be accompanied by an equally awkward conversation. This one went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, Tsuruya-chan?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is it, father?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can I ask who is she?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She's our friend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I noticed that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I-I mean, she is Suzumiya Haruhi. She goes to Kyon-kun's class and&amp;ndash;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ineffable relief washed over Yuuto at the fact it was a name he could recognize. That should teach him to pay attention to whatever his daughter says about her brother, however he wasn't ready to simply ask what the bit about "magical kisses" is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yuki, what do you mean with '25 meters'? Hello, are you there?" Haruhi's questions to the person at the other end of the line interrupted their dialogue. Yuuto then stopped the car because of a red light and almost simultaneously someone opened the passenger door and nonchalantly got on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer audacity of the small girl wearing Kitago's uniform kept Yuuto from doing or saying anything about it. The lavender-haired young lady greeted him with an oddly courteous nod given the situation and handed the big bag she was carrying over to the girls on the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hooded coats and shoes," she simply stated. Somehow, this instant was what surprised Yuuto the most until that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thanks Yuki-nyan!" Tsuruya was quick to take the bag. Probably most of teenage boys would be supremely distracted by the sounds of two beautiful girls trying to disentangle themselves from each other and get dressed in a confined space. Yuuto was too intrigued by their cryptic exchange to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yuki, what happened with the escape system you said you got in place?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is triggered when an unauthorized person tries to open the door."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then, what went wrong today, Yuki-nyan?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing. His father is trustworthy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSilence"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The following light will be red. Could you pull over the car next to the advertising sign?" It took Yuuto a few seconds to realize Yuki was speaking to him. After he fulfilled her request, the girl in the passenger seat bowed politely to him and formulated, "We apologize for any and all inconvenience you experienced this morning. I will see it will not happen again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is not&amp;ndash; Wait. Do you mean&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, just like them&amp;hellip;?" He asked, not quite pointing to Tsuruya and Haruhi leaving the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes. I'm looking forward to make an acquaintance with you under better circumstances in the future. Thank you." And with that, the youngest-looking girl of the group left the car and joined her friends, who waved their goodbyes through the door's window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, son and father treated the narrated events in a truest filial/parental fashion. The former didn't say a word about it and the latter sent occasional, unreadable weighted stares to his offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the third Sunday of June when the matter was finally yet indirectly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Kyon's small birthday party at home with his parents and sister, he discreetly handed an envelope over to his father. The next day at work, he opened it to find a "gift certificate" exchangeable for a five-day long practical course of the likes the government gives to drivers of emergency vehicles and instructions of how to contact someone called "Aida-san" to get the whole week containing said days as a paid vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can deny that Yuuto's parenting methods have their perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop quiz: List the instances where Haruhi used her &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter"&gt;TK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, I don't remember whether or how much Yuuto knows about Haruhi. I'm just guessing here. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="tvtropes"></category><category term="snippet"></category></entry><entry><title>The Stinger</title><link href="http://specularreflection.github.io/idle/tvt-kbdh-13996.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-14T15:15:49-04:00</updated><author><name>Specular</name></author><id>tag:specularreflection.github.io,2013-06-14:idle/tvt-kbdh-13996.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=3m4uvlo3cr9ksrpsdzmzhd78&amp;amp;page=560#13996"&gt;[Source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A continuation of sorts to &lt;a href="tvt-kbdh-13985.html"&gt;"Your Approval Fills Me with Shame"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While "Shutaro" seemed distracted testing the collisional properties of his own skull, a small conversation between two small entities took place on a table a few steps behind him and next to plate of cookies. It started as it frequently did, with a sudden question from the black-haired chibi to her blue-haired counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is a '&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy"&gt;Twin Threesome Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;'?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryouko instantly ran a search on the publicly-editable database where she suspected the term could be found and relayed a concise impression of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a common, usually male, fantasy where three individuals engage in what you call an 'entanglement', with the additional condition that two of them must be twin siblings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one of her slow and deliberate blinks, Kuyou requested further clarification. "Do sufficiently close time-divergent versions of the same person qualify as 'twins'?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would think so, but predetermination dictates that the Elder self must ensure that the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFutureSelfAndMe"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; goes exactly as he or she remembers it and it's required to keep careful track of every time-divergent object present, making the practice remarkable risky but not entirely unfeasible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuyou directed her attention to the person under the visual/auditive data manipulations that he used as a disguise and asked what Ryouko predicted she would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Would he be interested?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's possible according to Kyon-kun previous experiences but it's a moot question as none of the girls with whom he would potentially try that sort of thing have a twin sister and he would most likely avoid unnecessary risks of a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox"&gt;Temporal Paradox&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another moment of silence ensured and the presence of the small agent of the Sky Canopy Dominion vanished from Ryouko's senses, only to reappear with modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""A physical or this pseudo-physical simultaneous materialization is not excessively more difficult,"" two completely identical instances of Kuyou in her chibi form spoke to Ryouko in perfect synchronization, ""however I never considered it necessary as it should only provide redundant sensory information.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh! That's interesting." Ryouko said appreciatively. "I don't have the resources or the permits to attempt multithreading like that and while I can see how an equivalent of such technique could be useful for me, I fail to realize why you are bringing this up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her pet project of designing a set of tools suitable for Magical Radiant Nonoko would certainly benefit if she personally could stand in for the O.S. without neglecting similar duties for Kyon, to say nothing of spending a lot more time together with the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Close entanglement with him can easily overwhelm my capacity to handle the memetic surge, which precludes me from making precious observations."" Both constructs spoke, then pausing and blinking at the same time. ""I theorize that if I sustain another avatar and both participate, I will be able to better experience our time together or at least observe more of it.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryouko personally thought that Kuyou was just too excitable and such a thing would fix itself with time, but saying so now could dissuade her friend from a course of action that promised the opportunity of learning an useful skill from her. A policy that Yuki already proved as successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Parallel observation through several sets of human senses sounds like a good idea!" Ryouko encouraged the chibis "But we need to work on a few things first!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""What do you mean?""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That! Speaking in unison will get old very fast. Try to avoid it." the former IDSE interface asserted, striking a (quite cute) lecturing pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuyou(s) tilted her head(s) and asked "Is this acceptable?"/"How about this?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nope! Saying different things at once will just confuse people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Would this&amp;hellip;" the chibi at the left said and immediately the one at the right added "&amp;hellip; be better?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, but with moderation. Kyon-kun might find it off-putting before getting used."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see." the twin at the leftmost commented and both of them nodded. "I will refrain from fragmenting sentences." the other finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also. You don't need to do the same action at the same time with your interfaces. Think of them as a team instead! Think synergically!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Oh!"" both of them voiced, but they quickly corrected themselves and while the one at the left politely bowed in gratitude to Ryouko, the one at the right clapped her hands to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good!" Ryouko praised them with her arms crossed and a satisfied expression on her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, there was a time when Kyon was in for &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; a surprise when he woke up one morning in his bed, but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting&lt;/strong&gt;: Yanagimoto, Taniguchi, Mikuru and "Shutaro" go to a dinner double date at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Mikuru and Yanagimoto excuse themselves for a few minutes, "Shutaro" and Taniguchi are now alone at the private booth*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*notices an uncharacteristic quiet and pensive Taniguchi*&lt;/em&gt; Something in your mind?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSilence"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*waves hand*&lt;/em&gt; Are you al&amp;ndash;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Can I ask you a few questions?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises eyebrow*&lt;/em&gt; Sure, go ahead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;The other day when we first met, you and Asahina-san were walking around downtown together. Is that right?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Well, yes. We went to watch a movie that day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatLiarLies"&gt;That's a lie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Eh?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Allow me to explain. Just after we parted ways, Yanagimoto-hime called me from the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaraokeBox"&gt;Karaoke Box&lt;/a&gt; so we could met there after they finish their alloted time. I remember I could listen someoneâ€¦  erâ€¦  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodToneDeaf"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the background and now I realized that person was Asahina-san.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeTake"&gt;O_O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;So, what's going on, man? How can she be in two places, both separated by a thirty-minutes train trip by the way, at the same time?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Well&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;*thinks quickly*&lt;/em&gt; That was Mikuru-chan's sister, Asahina Michiru-san. I was helping her with something that day.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises eyebrow*&lt;/em&gt; Then, why didn't Asahina-san say a word about her having a sister? During dinner she told us several things about Kyon's little sister but nothing about her own &lt;em&gt;twin&lt;/em&gt;. Don't you think is weird?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;That's&amp;hellip; because there are some&amp;hellip; family problems between them I can't freely speak of.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Those "family problems" have something to do with the fact you called Michiru-san by Mikuru-san's &lt;em&gt;given name&lt;/em&gt; or the fact she was wearing &lt;em&gt;Kitago&lt;/em&gt;'s uniform?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap"&gt;!!!&lt;/a&gt; Er&amp;hellip; yes. As I said, there are family matters&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*sighs*&lt;/em&gt; Stop right there, dude. After so much weirdness around Suzumiya I think I can tell what really going on.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;You&amp;hellip; do?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;It's pretty obvious when you think about. Asahina-san was very obviously pining after Kyon for a year and then suddenly fell for his slightly less snarky double, no offence, who &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to know the twin sister she never speaks about? Tell me, do you want to say it or prefer to hear it from me?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*discretely goes for &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon"&gt;Altair&lt;/a&gt; in a silent &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns"&gt;stun-mode&lt;/a&gt;, points it at Taniguchi under the table*&lt;/em&gt; Shoot away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;You are two-timing them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Eh?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;To be precise, you and that other girl are cheating on her. You and Michiru-san probably were going out for a while now.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat"&gt;What&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;After Kyon got out of the picture because of his engagement with Tsuruya-sempai, you played the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementLoveInterest"&gt;Replacement Love Interest&lt;/a&gt; card with Asahina-san when she was most vulnerable. Oh, and Michiru-san is in the loop, otherwise she would have not disguised herself as her sister so that anyone who knew her and saw you two together would think that she was Asahina-san!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;What?!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;So, do you &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to play Asahina-san for a fool?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*angry*&lt;/em&gt; I would never&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Then, what? Do you two &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueThreesome"&gt;One True Threesome&lt;/a&gt;? Are you planning to reveal the whole thing to her after she gets so hooked up to you that she will accept? Dude, I never in my life expected to witness something so immoral, so disgusting, so crafty and so&amp;hellip; freaking&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;Awesome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Wait&amp;hellip; What? What th&amp;ndash;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*not listening*&lt;/em&gt; Just dating someone like Asahina-san would rate pretty high in my book but no, you just have to go out with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; S-rank girls. And not only that, you somehow convinced one of them to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; you to &lt;em&gt;date the other&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*massaging his forehead*&lt;/em&gt; Taniguchi, wait! You got it all wrong. The truth is&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*still not listening*&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;and last but not least, they are &lt;em&gt;twins&lt;/em&gt;. You are someone who is seriously aiming for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThreesomeFantasy"&gt;Twin Threesome Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm"&gt;Face Palm&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&amp;hellip; After learning all this, I don't know if I should beat you or &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt; to a pulp. However the &lt;a href="http://thedailybrocode.tumblr.com/post/48771817773"&gt;article 80&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBroCode"&gt;The Code&lt;/a&gt; is clear on this matter&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&amp;hellip; "The Code"? Is there a &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&amp;hellip; I shall assist you in whatever way you may require. Just promise me you will STAY FAR AWAY from Yanagimoto-hime. That's the way of the Bros after all! Do we have a deal?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yanagimoto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*suddenly*&lt;/em&gt; What kind of deal are you talking about? Wait. Why Shutaro-kun is &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadDesk"&gt;hitting his head against the table&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;*frowns*&lt;/em&gt; What did you just do, Tani-baka?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Mikuru enters the room with a platter in her hands*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikuru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Sorry for the wait, but look at this Shutaro-kun! The chef let me help out with our desserts and&amp;ndash; Are you OK K&amp;ndash;Shutaro-kun?! You have a growing haematoma on your face! We should place a cold compress ov&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;I-I'm fine Mikuru-chan, really.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikuru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*frowns*&lt;/em&gt; That won't do! Taniguchi-san, Yanagimoto-san, would it be much of a bother if we end our dinner now? I need to take Shutaro-kun to my apartment so I can treat his injury.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*turns to "Shutaro" with wide eyes and mouths a silent*&lt;/em&gt; (DUDE!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yanagimoto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;It's not a problem. &lt;em&gt;*elbows Taniguchi*&lt;/em&gt; Right?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Not at all. We missed dessert though&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikuru&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Don't worry about it! We can just ask for them as a takeaway.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*stands up*&lt;/em&gt; Yeah I'll go and&amp;hellip; settle the bill for now.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taniguchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Thanks a lot! You are my &lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt;, Shutaro!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Shutaro"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;I am not!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yamashina-ku, Kyoto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven men, all of them with previous criminal records, took a group of twenty-five children from an undisclosed primary school in a trip and their teacher hostage in the main shrine of the Gokoku-ji temple. By the time officials from the National Police Agency and Special Assault Team arrived to the scene, the situation was already under control, apparently, by the actions of an unknown third party.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eyewitnesses, all minors of twelve years old or younger, agree that someone they all identified as a young female named "Trope-tan" (a popular animated character from the eponymous TV show) appeared from nowhere and without directly attacking them, expertly manoeuvred the kidnappers into her chasing and round them up into a single spot. A particularly outlandish account affirm that one of them opened fire at her and the bullets disappeared into thin air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was then when a second, shorter female dressed in white whom the children identified as "Nanoha-chan", also an animated character from a different TV show, fired a "magical beam" called "Starlight Breaker" at six of the gathered perpetrators, knocking them out cold. The verisimilitude of such statements is obviously questionable, but paramedics confirmed that the condition of the still unconscious men at the moment of this writing partially, and only partially, matches the symptoms found in victims of accidental electrocution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The seventh and last abductor, who attempted to desert his associates and abscond the premises, was subdued by a woman who chose to remain anonymous. T.A.-san, that only then arrived to the shrine, saw the armed running man and realized the abnormality of the situation. Fast thinking, T.A.-san surprised the man with an incapacitating manoeuvre that rendered him unconscious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T.A.-san is the mother of one of children involved in the incident and one of several parents who accompanied the class in their trip to assist the teachers at&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think I've read enough.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What do you think?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You know we can't publish this, right?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ludicrous as it may be, it's the truth. From what I heard, even the NPA lady agent in charge of the case can't make any sense of it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;And let me guess, you want to title it as "Cosplaying Girls Saved Primary School Class from Kidnappers".&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nope, but close. So, it's a go?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Are you kidding me? We are not that kind of newspaper. The story is so absurd that no one is going to believe it. Did you get an interview at the very least? Something we can quote?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No, I couldn't. All the kids think the incident was some kind live performance and the police advised their parent to not break their delusion. None of them wanted to talk in front of their children.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What about T.A.-san?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip; I think you're trying to kid &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; now. If a woman who just kicked an armed man, twice my size, in the balls and then put him to sleep with a knee in the jaw when he doubled over in pain tells you "I don't want an interview" you just shut up, smile and walk away.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip; point.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I'll admit it. I just couldn't resist to give "T.A.-san" a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear"&gt;Mama Bear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfAwesome"&gt;Crowning Moment of Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I actually tried to cast Miyoko as the second &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl"&gt;Magical Girl&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the finishing blow and make Akane's actions more reasonable by placing Nonoko in more evident danger, but the girl with the ponytail absolutely refused to don Fate's barrier jacket.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly enough, Taniguchi wasn't a stranger to alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father was an old man with old ideas of how things should be done. Like his annoying policy to never take a leave from school without a 40Â°C fever or worse symptoms or his more interesting opinion that "a man should know how to handle his booze."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why it didn't take him too much to figure out what this head-splitting headache first thing in the morning was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds of definitely-not-whimpers, Taniguchi's first thought was to reach out for his cellphone and check the time. Even though the room was (thankfully) pretty dark, he had no trouble finding the device in its usual location at the head of his futon and to the side, close to the wall to avoid stepping on it by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday XXth, 6:03 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was about to turn off the daily alarm before it gets the chance to go off, Taniguchi noticed the first oddity of many this morning: his favorite wallpaper of his girlfriend was gone. Without really thinking about it, he devoted his slowly returning focus to put the image back on. He was serious about keeping the snapshot of a smiling Yanagimoto until she would eventually make him delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that he would really do it even in that case. &lt;em&gt;Girl has the cutest little smile ever when she thinks I'm not looking. I even had to beg Kunikida for the picture.&lt;/em&gt; Thinking of the shorter boy and the surliest expression he had on his face at the time (&lt;em&gt;seriously, what was that rant about never taking a photo by request ever again?&lt;/em&gt;), Taniguchi discovered oddity number two: he wasn't holding his phone. It was Kunikida's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the&amp;ndash;?" A quick inspection around also revealed that he slept with one of his nicest set of clothes on. &lt;em&gt;Mom is going to give me an earful about it.&lt;/em&gt; The light jacket was missing but Taniguchi found his wallet in one of his pants' back pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah, probably I took his cellphone by mistake last night."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts of how to recover his lost property or whether or not send a few prank messages to random contacts with his friend's mail account were drowned by the somewhat startling realization of the third and by far the biggest oddity so far: This wasn't his room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, it was too spacious. At a glance he could fit his bedroom two or three times within that much space. Secondly, even though it was soberly furnished, there was a distinctly &lt;em&gt;girly&lt;/em&gt; vibe in the decoration. Nothing too obvious like plush toys laying around, but he was sure that everything was cleaner and tidier than what any guy would care to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unless maids were somehow involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his brief lapsus to levity, Taniguchi put his newfound acuity to good use. Namely, finding out where he was and how to do it without bothering his probably still sleeping unknown host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His endeavor was surprisingly easy to accomplish. A short walk to the heavy-looking curtains uncovered one of those glass sliding doors behind the drapes and a not-too-small balcony. He was in an apartment building, a fifth or sixth floor judging by the overhead view of the city he could get from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it was too early for the sunrise light to hurt his currently oversensitive eyes but not too dark to miss the easily recognizable landmark of a nearby train station, one not that far to the east of Kitago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too worried about going back to home just yet, he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; got permission to sleep over at a friend's place after all, Taniguchi's found himself wondering if he was actually at a friend's place. A priori he could rule out the possibility of being in Kunikida's or Kyon's homes. He has visited the former enough times to not recognize it right away and a bit of thought confirmed that Kyon lived in a two-store house that Suzumiya used once to hold the audition for her band thing a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, his best bet so far was that he was at the residence of the fourth and last participant of yesterday's boys-only day out, one Koizumi Itsuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait. If memory serves me right&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Didn't Koizumi mention that he lived alone and away from his family? The guy must be pretty well-off to live in such an upmarket apartment on his own, that's for sure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After briefly contemplating about life's everyday unfairnesses, Taniguchi arrived to a more pressing issue: Did he just spend the night in the pretty boy's room and futon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabbing the phone and walking somewhat briskly out of the room, Taniguchi stepped into a corridor that opened to his right and found an ajar wooden door facing the bedroom. A little peek revealed that the room was a western-styled bathroom containing a bathtub surrounded by a shower screen, a laundry basket, toilet and washbasin. The latter immediately caught Taniguchi's attention and after fumbling around trying to illuminate the room, he found a little knob on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guessing from the lack of any other obvious switch that the dial's function has to be to turn on and off the lights, Taniguchi turned the dimmer slowly like he would do with the volume control of a radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Jackpot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taniguchi's small sense of triumph vanished the moment he faced his reflexion on the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, what can I say? I do look like shit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a moment of hesitation he let the cold water run and washed his face and tried to get his hair back in order, which was more difficult than the usual without the assistance of his favorite hair gel. Speaking of toiletries, the bathroom was strangely devoid of any. No soap, no toothpaste and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No towel."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wondering if moments like this made people say things about always knowing where one's towel is, Taniguchi searched through drawers, under the sink and even inside the laundry basket, only to find them empty. Before weighting the practicability of using his shirt's sleeves as a drying implement against the grief he would get from his mother for doing so, his eyes zoomed in on the only unexplored place of the room: the bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusual yes, but not too improbable. With nothing to lose, Taniguchi slided the opaqued glass open to find what he was looking for. And something else&amp;hellip; rather some&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biting back a more outspoken reaction, Taniguchi took a half step back and learned two things in that precise moment. One, big bathtubs can double as a place to sleep in a hurry if one place enough soft material, like a bunch of dry towels, on the hard and cold porcelain. And two, the sleeping Koizumi Itsuki can inexplicably make an unkempt hair, creased and stained clothes and a missing shoe look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter image led to reflexions on the potential revenues of selling such pictures among high school girls, but Taniguchi quickly dismissed such ignoble thoughts. For one, it would be wrong to take advantage of an acquaintance and budding friend like that and, more importantly, it would be a no-brainer to track down the pictures' source back to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking one unused towel with him and slowly closing the bathroom's door, Taniguchi pondered his options. It wasn't too early to find a train home, but probably the right thing to do right now was to check on the condition of each member of yesterday's quartet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of yesterday, what did they do last night? His memories were clear until they left the Game Center to grab a bite at a fast-food place. There Kyon was generous for once and paid for everyone's food (actually for the second time in Taniguchi's experience if one remembers that time after that baseball tournament last year). Then Kunikida noticed something about Kyon's wallet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was it?&amp;hellip; Now I remember!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discovered that Kyon owned a driving license. Not a permit, but a bona fide "Normal License" to drive must car weighting up to 5,000 kg, or so Kunikida told them. When he asked next how it was possible for Kyon to get one of those before turning eighteen, Taniguchi was sure Kyon begun to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't too obvious though, man had his deadpan so leveled-up that it takes something big like a Suzumiya-grade hijinks gone horribly wrong (or &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;) to get him to widen his eyes like that. That was when Koizumi laughed a little and told the rest about Kyon's little secret: he was, obviously, eighteen already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a trivial explanation made Taniguchi tempted to tsukkomi himself. Just because he and Kunikida were seventeen years old, it doesn't mean that everybody in class have exactly the same age. For example, Taniguchi knew that Goto, the class rep, turned seventeen before the start of the school year and Arakawa, the guy from the Karate club, was even taller and older-looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it's not like a guy worries about other guys' ages unless one of them can buy adult-only stuff for them like&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think now I know how last night got started."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the unexpectedly long corridor, Taniguchi arrived to the living room when a sudden noise bring him out of his reverie. It was really weird "bamf!", similar to the sound of air leaving an empty milk or juice carton when you press it flat with your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn't yet lucid enough to tell where the sound came from, but when a second one went off Taniguchi was certain that the latter came from just around a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking slowly towards the source (he wasn't scared of course, probably it was just the air conditioner doing weird noises when the apartment was all quiet like now, surely) he peeked with one eye from the corner of a wall, only to find an empty dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty was probably a misnomer though. There was no one at the table, but there was a big pot of something in the middle, placed on one of those heat retentive plates designed to keep food warm. There were also a ladle, four soup bowls on a pile, and a taller vase with several sets of chopsticks next to stack of paper napkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only then that his nostrils registered the enticing aroma of the warm, apparently homemade, food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before knowing what was he was doing, Taniguchi already was next to the table, ladle and bowl in hand, and about help himself when he saw the note. It was just an unsigned and unaddressed sheet of paper that read "I read once that chicken miso soup was good for hangovers. Eat it while it's still warm. P.S. Don't forget to wait for the timer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taniguchi didn't known about any kitchen timer, but he was sure about five things:&lt;br /&gt;
1) The neat, almost calligraphic missive was written by a girl. And if his gut was on the money, a beautiful one on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Said pretty girl was an unparalleled amazing cook.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Such a talented female was considerate enough to cook for four hung over guys without raising a word of complain.&lt;br /&gt;
4) Considering the time of the day and the state of the main inhabitant of the condo, such a paragon of kindness owned her own set of keys (a telltale sign of great trust) and she most likely wasn't a legal guardian because of the point #3 above.&lt;br /&gt;
5) Being forcefully waked up by cold water in the face because someone "accidentally" opened the shower's valve was a fitting divine punishment. Koizumi probably already used up all his karma points with such an impossible girlfriend anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, it's amazing how such a weak deductive process managed to get &lt;strong&gt;almost&lt;/strong&gt; everything spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing his third serving of soup, Taniguchi decided that he should try to find his other two Drinking Pals (temporary designation) before undertaking his Crusade For World Fairness (temporary designation). If Belldandy (also a temporary designation) placed four bowls on the table, probably she knew for a fact there were (or should be) four people in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where to start? Easy: the living room. Anything else involves engaging in the nosy and potentially scarring activity of opening unknown doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, there he found two silent, probably sleeping, young men sat on a big couch with their backs facing him. The one at the right, with his arm hanging over the sofa's side,  was undoubtedly Kyon. He was the only person he knew who still persists on wearing a warm clothing item like his greatcoat that far within the hot season. It was amazing for Taniguchi how he never saw Kyon sweat in that getup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about how well his two classmates fared after the blank in his memories known as "last night", Taniguchi rounded the couch and took in their visages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then stopped dead in his tracks, his mind failing at trying to make sense of the sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taniguchi's musings were partially correct. The guy at the right side of the coach, the left side from his current perspective, was indeed Kyon. He didn't look too bad. Kyon either was an unexpectedly heavy drinker or he got saddled as the designated driver. Most likely the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late teen/early twenty-something guy at the right was the problem. First off, he was not Kunikida. Secondly, the unknown tall blond had bruises and small cuts all over his face and, with the exception of the jacket, his clothes surely had seen better days. And thirdly, his right arm was handcuffed to Kyon's left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some part of Taniguchi's brain remained in working condition and dutifully totalled facts and drew hypotheses while his conscious mind rebooted. Obviously something happened to Mr. John Doe last night. Either he took a beating or fell down some long stairs. Repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, scratch that. Closer inspection revealed that John Doe's body in fact fared far better than his clothes. No broken nose for one, and the black spots on his face weren't too swollen. Strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage on his clothes was odd too. In some places they looked burned. In others they looked cut in suspiciously straight and clean lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait a moment, is that my jacket?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it was, but Taniguchi could already tell he won't get it back too soon. The handcuffs were in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, handcuffs. And a weird looking pair on top of that. Both cuffs were wide, a pair of matching big bracelets like the ones Punk/Rock/whatever band members wear in TV. Instead of a chain, the cuffs were connected by a cable, similar to the wire ropes used on suspension bridges but this one was thin like a pinky. Also, the whole contraption was sleek black unlike every pair of handcuffs he saw on Police Dramas or movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he noticed that, Taniguchi was sure that the time in Japan was exactly 6:30:00 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew because he daily got up at that time and, more importantly, because the shrill alarm of his cellphone went off at six and a half sharp every morning. Just like it was doing it now from the inner pocket of his jacket. Rousing the person wearing it, who Taniguchi would know later as Fujiwara, back to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would also learn later that morning that Kunikida never put a foot on the residence number 505 of certain apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what mattered the most to Taniguchi right now was the fact that loaded stares from his father, mother and recently his girlfriend didn't hold a candle to this guy's half-surprised/half-menacing glare fired from less than a foot away. It was like the look alone could tell him that the blond could kick his ass six ways to Sunday if he just made one wrong move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;hellip;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"C-Can I get my phone back? The alarm gets worse every ten seconds or so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;".... Sure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#167;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting&lt;/strong&gt;: Haruhi and Kyon are walking home after school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kyon, I don't think I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have to say this to you, but after Sasaki it'd be for the best if you just stop.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stop? Stop what?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare"&gt;hooded stare&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; You know what I'm taking about.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises eyebrow, thinks to himself a little*&lt;/em&gt; Actually, I'm&amp;hellip; not? Could you-?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Are you really going to make me say it?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OK, take it easy. If there's something I can freely admit to you is that there are topics I simply don't g&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;*reads Haruhi's expression, realization hits*&lt;/em&gt; Wait! That's&amp;ndash; seriously&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;*blushes*&lt;/em&gt; you can't be saying you honestly believe I have been.... well&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes, yes I am. So do I have your word that from now on you'll depart from the way of the typical &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel"&gt;Light Novel&lt;/a&gt; male protagonist and you won't get a couple of new &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests"&gt;Love Interests&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc"&gt;Story Arc&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*blushes harder*&lt;/em&gt; H-Haruhi! I-I swear it was never my intention&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*sighs*&lt;/em&gt; I know, I really do. Just keep the mojo at manageable levels and we'll just have to worry about easier stuff like a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror"&gt;Multiversal Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens"&gt;Sufficiently Advanced Aliens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza"&gt;institutionalized criminal organizations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking"&gt;your mother&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope"&gt;Wait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother"&gt;I take the last one back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;......... Haruhi?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mhm?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can I ask you a question without you getting mad?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*pauses*&lt;/em&gt; That's probably the worst preamble to ask a question&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;*cautious*&lt;/em&gt; Sure&amp;hellip; go ahead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;How do I do that?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Do what?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stop&amp;hellip; doing the thing I'm supposedly doing. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; wondered &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; times how it's even possible that we all ended in this whole &lt;em&gt;*ambiguous gesture*&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; but I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode"&gt;sincerely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have no idea. I have always tried to be a good &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;, to be there for all of you and don't&amp;hellip; So, how&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;*shrugs*&lt;/em&gt; how do you think I should go about that?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence"&gt;......&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...... Haruhi?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveGOTToBeKiddingMe"&gt;You Have GOT To Be Kidding Me&lt;/a&gt;!! Wait a second! Don't say a word! Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; you're telling the truth, that's why&amp;ndash; OK listen, you just have to.. or rather, don't let&amp;hellip; make sure you don't&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I'm listening.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Damn it, I simply can't&amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment"&gt;Yes!&lt;/a&gt; Just "think Taniguchi".&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat"&gt;What&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Think like Taniguchi. If you ever find yourself in a &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim"&gt;Dating Sim&lt;/a&gt;-like situation with some other girl, ask yourself: "&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo"&gt;What Would Taniguchi Do?&lt;/a&gt;" It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be a sure-fire way to kill the mood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You can't be serious.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, it's that or one of us will have to elbow you &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; in the ribs each time you are about to &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EventFlag"&gt;raise a flag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I don't even know what that means, but I get your point. Think Taniguchi, think Taniguchi&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Right. As a practice, let's say I'm an unknown normal girl you just rescued from rampant hoodlums. What would you do?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*raises eyebrow*&lt;/em&gt; If the situation is under control, I would ask Ryouko to examine your condition while I call the police and make you a few simple questions to try to distract you a little from the incident.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Good plan, wrong answer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OK. Like Taniguchi. How about doing the same while I strike a pose and ask you â€˜Are you alright?â€™?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Better. Ham it up a little. Then I'd go with a â€˜I'm fine. Thanks for helping me.â€™ Your turn.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*rolls eyes*&lt;/em&gt; Right &lt;em&gt;*thinks for a moment then places a hand on Haruhi's shoulder, looks into her eyes and speaks to her softly*&lt;/em&gt; â€˜As if I could leave a girl as cute as you alone in a situation like that. Are you sure you are OK?â€™&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;*full-blown &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuminescentBlush"&gt;Luminescent Blush&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip; Haruhi?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ARGHH!! How can you&amp;ndash; Damn it! I have to go now, see you tomorrow. &lt;em&gt;*stomps away*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wait! Haruhi! What did I&amp;ndash;?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haruhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Later!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
